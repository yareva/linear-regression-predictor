# Linear Regression Predictor 
This project uses a simple linear regression model to predict test scores based on hours studied. It demonstrates the basics of machine learning using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib — perfect for beginners exploring data science and AI.

# Description

The goal of this notebook is to:
- Visualize the relationship between hours studied and test scores.
- Train a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`.
- Make predictions (e.g., "If a student studies 6 hours, what score will they likely get?").
- Plot the regression line with actual data points.

# Technologies / Libraries Used

- **Python 3.11**
- `pandas` – for handling tabular data
- `numpy` – for working with arrays and numbers
- `matplotlib` – for visualizing data and results
- `scikit-learn` – for training the linear regression model
